# Lessons Learned

I built this app in order to learn the following topics: 
   
   - _**MVVM architecture**_
     - [x] Preserve user state across device configuration changes
     - [x] Maintain Business Logic outside of composable functions
     - [x] Apply seperates of concerns principle
     - [x] Implement Ui States.
    
   - _**Adpative UI**_
     - [x] Build an adaptive layout to support multiple screen sizes.
      
   - _**Jetpack Compose Navigation**_
     - [x] Navigates between multiple screens.
     - [x] Sharing data with another app using intents.
     - [x] Manipulate the back stack to navigate to previous screens.
     
   - **_and more..._**.

# Prerequisites

  It's recommended to have these _**prerequisites**_ for completing this project:

  1. Familiar with how to create UI layouts in Compose, and how to make them adaptive to different screen sizes
  2. Ability to add and implement the Jetpack Navigation component with Compose
  3. Ability to implement an app with the recommended app architecture.

# Low-Fi

  ![low-fi](https://github.com/nabilBouzineDev/Fes-MyCityApp/assets/139881384/18b5bf5c-14fd-47ff-97e5-b465891088a7)

  - I made a simple model that provides me a basic idea of what the app looks like.
  - Later on, I sketch some arrows to illustrate the navigation of the app.
  - Finally, I implement the logic and layout of the app using **_Kotlin_** and **_Jetpack Compose_** library.
